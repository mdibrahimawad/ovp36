# OVP-36 OOB model benchmark

Standalone research benchmark. **Stage 1 only:** strict schemas, TOML
configuration, and read-only JSONL dataset loading/validation. Model execution,
adapters, parsers, scoring, reports, and serving are not implemented yet.

The requirements are `docs/BENCHMARK_SPEC.md`, `docs/SOURCE_AUDIT.md`, and
`docs/CASE_MATRIX.md`, together with the approved source corrections from plan
review. Those documents have not been modified in this stage.

## Development

Python **>=3.12,<3.13** is required. With uv installed:

```sh
uv sync --locked
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Without uv, install this package using Python 3.12 in an isolated environment:

```sh
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e .
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The uv lockfile pins runtime dependencies; the pip alternative resolves the
version range from `pyproject.toml`. Tests use synthetic cases in temporary
directories and need no network, model, credentials, or external services.

## Data contracts

`schemas.py` defines all six task IDs and their typed input/gold models. It also
defines explicit `model`, `adapter_control`, `response_contract`, and
`transport_contract` exercises. Contract assertions cannot substitute for gold
in model exercises. Result foundation schemas require an exercise identity;
aggregation and execution are deferred.

- Models reject unknown fields and incorrect primitive types. JSON arrays become
  tuples; JSON enum strings become enum values. Direct Python construction uses
  typed enums and tuples under Pydantic strict validation.
- Models are frozen. Opaque JSON dictionaries, such as QA metrics, are not deeply
  frozen and must be treated as read-only. Dataset operations never mutate them.
- Only `ovp34_replay` cases may set `expected` to null. This rule also requires
  explicit expected assertions for curated/adversarial control cases.
- Extraction types are string, number, and boolean. Known gold must match the
  declared type; every missing field needs an explicit missing-value policy.
- The three summary gold types share one fact-annotation schema. Named categories
  reference required-fact IDs; correction pairs reference old/new facts.
- QA gold uses a score target or an ordered acceptable range. Tags remain strings
  so a later frozen prompt contract can validate its vocabulary.
- Evidence offsets are half-open character spans. Structural validation checks
  pointers/offsets; resolving them against inputs belongs to fixture validation
  when actual curated fixtures are added.

`load_cases(path_or_paths)` reads UTF-8 JSONL into a tuple of cases. It rejects
invalid/blank lines, duplicate object keys, non-standard numeric constants,
invalid schemas, and duplicate IDs, including across files. Errors identify the
source file and line without echoing the raw fixture.

`select_cases(...)` intersects task/source/difficulty/critical/exercise filters;
tag filtering requires all supplied tags. No filter means unrestricted; an empty
task/source/difficulty/exercise selection matches no cases.

`hash_dataset(cases)` hashes all normalized case content in sorted ID order.
Whitespace, JSON object key order, and file ordering do not affect it. Message
order, gold, exercise kind, and provenance do. It is a dataset content hash, not
a future execution-order or prompt-artifact hash.

`validate_matrix_coverage(cases, expected_ids)` checks caller-supplied IDs and
raises on missing/unexpected IDs. `require_complete=False` returns gaps for
partial-suite development. No curated or replay data is created in Stage 1.

## Configuration

This example describes the schema; there is no executable benchmark runner yet:

```toml
experiment_label = "local-development"
evaluation = "exploratory" # or "canonical"
timeout_seconds = 30.0
concurrency = 1
repetitions = 1

[endpoint]
alias = "local"
base_url_env = "OVP36_BASE_URL"
model_env = "OVP36_MODEL"
# api_key_env = "OVP36_API_KEY" # omit for endpoints without authentication

[generation]
temperature = 0.0
max_tokens = 4000
top_p = 1.0
# seed = 7
```

`load_config(path)` uses `tomllib` without reading environment values.
`resolve_endpoint(config.endpoint)` resolves only named variables. A missing or
blank referenced variable raises an error. Literal `base_url`/`model` may be used
instead of their environment references, but not alongside them.

API keys can only be supplied through environment references. URLs containing
userinfo, query parameters, or fragments are rejected. Resolved endpoint values
are excluded from ordinary serialization and repr; `redact_config(config)` saves
the unresolved configuration. Keep local configuration and secrets out of Git.

The generation limit is explicit for every configuration. The approved runtime
summary contract uses **max_tokens=4000** and a **30-second timeout**; future
task-aware configuration/adapters will enforce these canonical settings. This
Stage 1 schema is task-neutral and does not infer a task from those numbers.

No Granite checkpoint, quantization, or serving runtime is selected. Their
configuration remains a decision before local serving. GB10/DGX access and
hardware measurements follow local validation in a later stage.
